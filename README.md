===================

Some simple scaffolding for angular projects

## To Use:

Copy the files, then `bower install` to install the vendor libraries

## Why?

This is (currently) the way I like to organize angular project files. It has some roots in ng-boilerplate, but with differences I like: starter files for models, services, etc. in `/common`, model definition files in `lib`, etc.

## To Do

- Move this all to a `src` directory and add a grunt build process.
- Start test spec files.
- CSS preprocessor (I prefer the scss flavor of SASS).
